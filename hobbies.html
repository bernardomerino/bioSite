                <p>
                    One of Tyrone’s favorite pastimes is skateboarding. It’s not just a hobby but a way for him to feel 
                    free, unwind, and stay active. He often spends his weekends exploring new skate parks or cruising 
                    around the city, perfecting his tricks and enjoying the thrill of the ride.

                    life, strengthening their bond and bringing happiness into his daily routine.

                    It’s not about lifting the heaviest weights or running the longest distances for Tyrone, it's 
                    about staying healthy and maintaining a balanced lifestyle. His dedication to his routine keeps 
                    him energized and focused for the logn 60 hour shifts he has to often work.

                    including New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. He’s always eager to explore new places, try new 
                    foods, and immerse himself in different cultures. Each trip is a new opportunity to learn and 
                    grow, making memories that last a lifetime whenever he goes with his friends.
